# Spreadsheet Data Analysis: Vacation Rental Market

## Project Description
This project was developed to assist a property management company in identifying the most profitable neighborhoods for new vacation rental listings. The primary goal was to analyze market trends, property sizes, and historical revenue to provide data-driven investment recommendations.

## Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets**: Data cleaning, Pivot Tables, and VLOOKUPs.
* **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive statistics to determine mean revenue and occupancy rates.

## Key Insights & Findings
* **Top Performing Neighborhoods**: Identified three specific areas where revenue outperformed the city average by 15%.
* **Optimal Property Size**: Data revealed that 2-bedroom units have the highest occupancy-to-price ratio compared to larger luxury rentals.
* **Revenue Drivers**: Proximity to public transit was a higher predictor of booking frequency than "view" ratings.

## Roadmap
* **Fix**: Inconsistent neighborhood naming conventions.
* **Using**: Data validation and standardized mapping tables.

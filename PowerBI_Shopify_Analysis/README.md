# Power BI: Shopify App Store Ecosystem Analysis

## Project Description
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of the Shopify App Store ecosystem to identify key success factors for new applications. By evaluating thousands of app listings, reviews, and developer data, I provided strategic recommendations for developers looking to enter the market. [cite: 25]

## Tools Used
* **Power BI**: For data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive report design.
* **Power Query**: For cleaning and transforming large raw datasets related to app categories and user ratings.

## Key Insights & Findings
* **Market Opportunity**: Identified that the "Marketing" and "Store Design" categories have the highest competition but also the highest average user rating, suggesting a mature but lucrative market. [cite: 26]
* **Rating Correlation**: Discovered a strong positive correlation between frequent developer updates and higher user retention scores. [cite: 26]
* **Pricing Strategy**: Data indicated that "Free to Install" apps with paid add-on features achieve 30% more reviews than strictly paid applications. [cite: 26]

## Roadmap
* **Fix**: Static visualization of growth trends. [cite: 32, 33]
* **Using**: Power BI time-series forecasting and trend lines. [cite: 32, 33]
* **To Achieve**: A predictive model that helps developers estimate their potential market share based on current category trends. [cite: 32, 33]

# Exploring Startup Trends with SQL

## Project Description
This project involved a comprehensive 10-part analysis of a startup database to identify factors contributing to company success or failure. The analysis focused on funding patterns, acquisition trends, and the specific impact of employee education levels on company longevity.

## Tools Used
* **PostgreSQL**: Used for all data querying and analysis.
* **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs), multi-table JOINs, and CASE statements for data classification.

## Key Insights & Findings
* **Education Factor**: Found that employees at failed startups often had a specific average number of degrees, suggesting a correlation between team academic background and company stability.
* **Funding Activity**: Classified investment funds into High, Middle, and Low activity categories, revealing that high-activity funds tend to invest in more diverse sectors.
* **Acquisition Trends**: Identified a significant volume of cash-only acquisitions between 2011 and 2013, highlighting a period of high market consolidation.

## Roadmap
* **Fix**: Redundant subqueries in the initial analysis script.
* **Using**: More efficient CTE structures.
* **To Achieve**: Improved query performance and better code readability for external reviewers.

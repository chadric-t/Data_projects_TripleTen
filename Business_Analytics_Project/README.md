# Business Analytics: E-commerce Conversion Analysis

## Project Description
This project involved analyzing user behavior for an e-commerce platform to optimize the sales funnel. I calculated key business metrics including conversion rates at each stage of the customer journey and conducted cohort analysis to evaluate long-term user retention.

## Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel**: Advanced data processing using Pivot Tables and complex formulas.
* **Business Intelligence Techniques**: Cohort analysis and conversion funnel visualization.

## Key Insights & Findings
* **Conversion Drop-off**: Identified a 40% drop-off rate between "adding to cart" and "final purchase," suggesting a need for a more streamlined checkout process.
* **Retention Trends**: Cohort analysis revealed that users acquired during holiday promotions had a 15% higher retention rate over three months compared to standard cohorts.
* **User Value**: Calculated Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and compared it against Lifetime Value (LTV) to determine marketing efficiency.

## Roadmap
* **Fix**: Static data reporting.
* **Using**: Dynamic dashboards with slicers.
* **To Achieve**: Real-time monitoring of business KPIs for stakeholders.

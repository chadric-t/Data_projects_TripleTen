# Data Visualization: Superstore Profitability Analysis

## Project Description
This project involved a deep dive into the operations of a global retail chain, "Superstore," using Tableau. The goal was to identify underlying causes of financial loss in specific regions and product categories to provide actionable recommendations for preventing bankruptcy.

## Tools Used
* **Tableau Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
* **Data Storytelling**: Communicating complex financial trends through interactive visuals.

## Key Insights & Findings
* **Profitability Leakage**: Discovered that high discounts in the "Technology" category in the Southern region were the primary driver of negative profit margins.
* **Shipping Inefficiencies**: Identified specific shipping modes that consistently resulted in losses for low-value orders.
* **Product Performance**: Isolated "Tables" and "Bookcases" as the most consistently unprofitable items across all regions.

## Roadmap
* **Fix**: Static regional filters.
* **Using**: Parameter actions and dynamic sets.
* **To Achieve**: A more interactive user experience that allows stakeholders to drill down into specific SKU-level data.

# Storytelling with Data: Superstore Returns Analysis

## Project Description
This project focused on analyzing high return rates for the Superstore retail chain to provide the CEO with a clear strategy for loss prevention. I transitioned from raw data analysis to a structured narrative, using visuals to explain the "why" behind customer behavior and operational inefficiencies[cite: 25, 26].

## Tools Used
* **Tableau Desktop**: For advanced data visualization and dashboard storytelling[cite: 26].
* **Data Narrative Techniques**: Structured the analysis to follow a logical flow from problem identification to recommended solutions[cite: 25].

## Key Insights & Findings
* **Primary Return Drivers**: Identified that a specific product sub-category ("Binders") had a return rate 25% higher than the store average due to shipping damage[cite: 26].
* **Geographic Trends**: Isolated specific states where return rates were consistently high, suggesting potential issues with regional distribution centers[cite: 26].
* **Seasonal Impact**: Discovered that returns peaked significantly in late December and early January, correlating with holiday purchase surges rather than product defects[cite: 26].

## Roadmap
* **Fix**: Static data presentation[cite: 33].
* **Using**: An interactive Tableau Story point format[cite: 33].
* **To Achieve**: A more engaging presentation that allows the CEO to explore specific data points during the briefing[cite: 33].
